# ðŸ”„ Python Chapter 5: Mastering Loops

Welcome to Chapter 4 of my Python journey â€” a deep dive into **loops**, where logic meets repetition.

Loops are the **heartbeat of automation** in programming. From printing sequences to finding elements, this chapter helped me master how to make Python repeat tasks efficiently and logically.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Covered

- `while` loops â€“ the classic repetition tool
- `for` loops â€“ perfect for iterating through sequences
- `break` & `continue` â€“ control the flow
- Looping through:
  - Lists
  - Strings
  - Tuples
- Real-life examples:
  - Printing numbers
  - Tables with `range()`
  - Linear search

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concept

> *"Loops aren't just repetition â€” they're structure, automation, and logic in motion."*

## ðŸ”— Repository Purpose

This repo is part of my **hands-on Python practice**. It documents not just code, but also **my progress, reflections, and thought process** as I build a strong foundation in programming.
